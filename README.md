[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/msbuildextensionpack/badge/?version=latest)](http://msbuildextensionpack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The **MSBuild Extension Pack** provides a collection of over 480 MSBuild Tasks, MSBuild Loggers and MSBuild TaskFactories.

A high level summary of what the tasks currently cover includes the following:

* System Items: Active Directory, Certificates, COM+, Console, Date and Time, Drives, Environment Variables, Event Logs, Files and Folders, FATP, GAC, Network, Performance Counters, Registry, Services, Sound
* Code: Assemblies, CAB Files, Code Signing, DynamicExecute, File Detokenisation, GUID’s, Mathematics, Strings, Threads, Xml, Zip Files
* Applications: BizTalk 2006 / 2009, Email, IIS6, IIS7, MSBuild, SourceSafe, SQL Server 2005 /2008, StyleCop, Twitter, Team Foundation Server, Visual Basic 6, Windows Virtual PC, WMI

The *MSBuild Extension Pack* is provided in two versions. The 3.5.* version supports the .Net Framework 3.5 and the 4.0.* version supports the .Net Framework 4.0.

The *MSBuild Extension Pack* implements a *TaskAction* based design which aims to improve usability and maintenance whilst reducing the code base, e.g. to start or stop a website, typically two task files would be created to perform each task, whereas the *MSBuild Extension Pack* accomplishes this in a single task file using TaskAction=”Stop” and TaskAction=”Start”. 

Each task is documented and provided with an example in the help file, which is also available online at [www.msbuildextensionpack.com](http://www.msbuildextensionpack.com/). Where applicable, tasks are remote enabled, simply specify a MachineName with optional credentials and the task will target the remote machine.
